# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

Program designed to print the number of words and numbers of characters within .txt files of books.

Usage for terminal: $ python3 main.py <path_to_file>

While there are a number of ways to obtain .txt files of books, many Creative Commons books can be downloaded to .txt files using the command
        $ wget -O <file.txt> <url>
            where:

            <file.txt> is the filename of your choice for the book
                    example (Moby Dick): mobydick.txt

            <url> is the url of the web page containing the book
                    example (Moby Dick): https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701.txt

https://www.gutenberg.org/ is the recommended website for download of Creative Commons books.
